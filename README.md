??What's sea urchins??  
-Sea urchin, or *uni* (pronounce ooo-nie) is popular sushi topping in Japan. 
-I saw some restaurants in NYC serves uni *nigiri* but little I knew about uni in the US.
-In this project, I analyzed the sea urchin landings in the US and found that California produces the most sea urchins.
-Looking closed the Californian data, I realized that the landings decreased dramatically due to ocean environment change, which was resulted from climate change.
-Ironically, because of the decline of the edible sea urchin population, non-edible purple sea urchins flourished in the Californian Coast.
