**??What's sea urchin = uni??**  
- Sea urchin, or *uni* (pronounce ooo-nie) is popular sushi topping in Japan. 
- I saw some restaurants in NYC serves uni *nigiri* but little I knew about uni in the US.
- In this project, I analyzed the sea urchin landings in the US and found that California produces the most sea urchins.
- Looking closed the Californian data, I realized that the landings decreased dramatically due to ocean environment change, which was resulted from climate change.
- Ironically, because of the decline of the edible sea urchin population, non-edible purple sea urchins flourished in the Californian Coast. 

## What I did with which skill
- Python (BeautifulSoup, Selenium, pandas, ggplot) :for data analysis
- datawrapper :for data viz

- **Thing that I tried and feel satisfied**: Finding relevant datasets what I looked forüòä Datawrapper skills and data bizüòä Feel more confident using html/cssüòä
- **Thing that I tried but couldn't complete**: I found Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency‚Äôs Earth observation satellite database and succeeded to downloading sea surface temperatures rise images in the California Coast [G\-PortalTop](https://gportal.jaxa.jp/gpr/) but found it extremely difficult to dealing with .h5 file to adapt them on the shapefile üò• (I tried to create a map with QGIS)
